DummyPlayers
============
DummyPlayers is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin that is able to spawn 'dummy players'. Yes you heard me! The server recognizes and treats the dummy players as if they were any other player. This plugin was originally created to stress test servers, but if you get a bit creative I'm sure you'll find other uses ;)

How to install
==============
To install this fabulous plugin simply drop it into the plugins directory of you Craftbukkit or Spigot server!
